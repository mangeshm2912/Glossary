The Maharashtra Times (Mumbai Edition), a vernacular daily in Marathi,
was launched in 1962 and has a rich history of print media, spanning over
decades. The collection of pages containing articles, advertisements, and
other contents in this newspaper is currently available in microfilm format,
with an estimated 0.24 million pages archived. These microfilms represent
valuable historical, cultural, and informational resources but are not easily
accessible for research, referencing, or day-to-day use due to their
physical nature.
In addition, the eSamay, a vernacular daily in Bengali, launched in 2012
year, shares a similar need for digitization. Both editions represent
significant regional media assets, contributing to the preservation and
availability of important historical and contemporary data in the respective
languages.
The project will ensure the preservation of valuable historical content in a
long-lasting and easily accessible digital format, which is crucial given the
physical deterioration risks of microfilms over time.
